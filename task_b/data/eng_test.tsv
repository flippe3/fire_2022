Eng_02	R u still with ur partner
Eng_03	excellent movie..no unnecessary drama or scenes.. was very natural..back ground music is really superb..thank u everyone involved fr giving a wonderful movie to watch..best thing was the lead actors were depicted MALE-ISH.. quite contrary to most directors who like to show gay love happens between some one who has FEMININE body and thoughts..well done sir. Looking forward fr more movies frm U.
Eng_04	For those who speak about culture., pre marital sex, illegal affairs after marriage, rape and a long lost will continue which is not Indian culture . Being gay/ lesbian/ transgender Is hormone imbalance, even before they are born. It’s not they choose to become. Even your son or daughter can be.. Like if you agree, and I don’t care for dislikes or hate replies.
Eng_05	Best movie and people not understand relationship feeling I miss my life

Eng_63	The person who asking completely doesn't know about homosexuals...homosexual is a disease..??bull shit..it's genetically involved.how he can asking this kind of questions?

Eng_66	Everyone have there feeling please respect. We are polluting nature and speaking homosexual is unnatural. Come out of the box and respect everyone. Great speech from Malini. Anchor need to listen, understand and ask.
Eng_67	Sathya Narayanan , it was encouraged in western world even today.. It's seen as an alternative to marriage.. For example, Few women groups say/encourage this way of life to escape from men, they claim men are aggressive n dominant.. Escape from them n stay with your own gender.. I meant those kind of things... Of course it's a threat to humanity.. It's one of the main reason why white ppl are becoming minorities in the own land..
Eng_68	A simple well scripted and acted out movie that addresses the issue with due intensity. And a very soothing yet powerful music to compliment the scenes. Congrats to the team.
Eng_69	Such a caring person ❤️💕

Eng_193	That is god problem
Eng_194	There are really some people who's brain needs to be grown.. Let the person be homosexual or hetro or bisexual or transgender - treat everyone as humans.. What's wrong in it.. How male and female have feelings and attraction towards each other... Same male male or female female also have.. It's genetics what you or me can do. It's natural..there are even people like bisexual. They get attraction towards male and even females both.. It's not wrong.. Culture culture what culture you guys expecting.. If we say male to not have sex with female..? Is it okay.. Same like that gay or lesbians.. Understand that they are born like that.. It's natural.. Treat everyone as humans.. And don't be abusive.. You have no rights to decriminate others feelings..
Eng_195	Pls bro don't play with anyone fellings. If anyone in that fellings to ask help from anyone, they think it's prank. and pls be serious bro
Eng_196	We support LGBT...that girl is stylish and awesome...
Eng_197	Romba heart touching irukka bro
Eng_198	oh god. same bigotry. A Muslim's parents allowed and accepted everything. But, a Hindu father is against. lol. And they want us to believe it. Being Gay is natural. And it is irrespective of religion. But, how can you forget the religion? and why it has always to be a liberal open minded Muslim and misogynist, bigoted, communal and kattar Hindu? Are your guts not full with the Bollywood and tollywood bigotry that you are bring this bullshit here too? shame on you.

Eng_226	Super bro new thinking make your success keep rocking then the acter of this prank has a great future vera level
Eng_227	Thanks for awareness...
Eng_228	You father is getting by homosexual then how to you born in the world. Your speech was not justice for human being very talented. So your homosexual thinking created and developed by yourself and by your living situation. That's your problem so don't criticize to anybody for this issues. Peoples be allotted and keep to distance of this type of guys I advise to all the peoples especially for young generations. This is our culturally very bad and worst activities and God's is not creating this type of homosexual man's and lespian woman's.
Eng_229	Thank god I learnt tamil... It would have been a disgrace to miss out such wonderful content in tamil cinema.. It's a wonderfully written story and gracefully executed.

U r just scared to stand on ur own and so u use culture as a shield so everyone will accept ur point. but y r u so obsessed with LGBT+ ban wat did we do to u?? Is it because the lesbian girls stole all the chances u had with the bi girls? If not, how about minding ur own business? U can b more productive if u stop all this hate!

Eng_282	havish srinivasula we think tat if schools n other institutions do not ask our caste then we will forget it. Tats a myth. Do u think caste is such a small thing tat ppl will forget. NO. It may happen in some cities. But India majority is village. Ppl always remember their caste, take pride in tat and discriminate others. Reservation system is their to give some relief to the discriminated ppl. ; ; So root cause of reservation system is discrimination.; ; Reservation is just a remedy to give relief.; ; We cannot remove remedy first. tat will be unfair.; ; We should remove the root cause first. Then eventually remedy will not be required. And we can achieve reservation system free society.
Eng_283	anu lavanya thanks Anu.. Think you too have to make a deep analysis in this.. do refer articles on this, there are mixed opinions and I don't think no one has proven this as a harmonial/genetical disorder. I am not taking abt the transgender over here..

Eng_384	Really great they are . Good hearted persons too ❤️❤️
Eng_385	Thank you so much for all the actors and I would like to say to everyone that IM GAY and I really loved it. And this is what even now after 3 years, it still happens and many lgbtq are leaving their homes and roaming in streets. And many are under corrective rape, and some are being killed and physically abused and many are still thinking thst being lgbtq is a disease or illness. Even my parents say it to me daily even though they know thsg I'm gay. I wish they will change.
Eng_386	You look like real lady very beautifully.
Eng_387	First the community should start accepting inter caste wedding !!
Eng_388	nature? then why they have pussy? lol?
Eng_389	Shrinivasan Kannan do you know the worst illness in the world? stubbornness. i can see how strong you ar in your believes. its okay to that, remember if you can evolve yourself in this technological era I am sure your next generation can definitely do, you are just an example for your children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and so on. so just relax and take chill pill. :)

Eng_400	Super Vera level ....thambi👍 I am waiting part 2
Eng_401	Vasim asaraf k u think this culture understands femininity. This culture is the first one that teaches wrong femininity. Letz not go to Islam. tatz a shock. letz take Tamil literature only as example. Four qualities of a woman. Accham, madam, naanam , payirpu. Just tell me in this four qualities, which is useful for woman or mother? According to me femininity is mother tatz it. Im asking what ur culture has thought to that mother? u guyz speak very high abt mother bt u speak bad about woman. U say she is weak. How can a weak woman become a mother? Todays mother are future generation. Have we thought this to our women? Leave feminism did culture understand women?
Eng_402	This girl lives in 2050

Eng_434	The message u delivering is good but don't use her emotions for just a prank, after realizing its prank she may also hurt, playing with anybody emotions is not good bro
Eng_435	We are a like this movie..... It's very inspirational movie..... waite for part 2 or next movie..... 👏👏
Eng_436	actually should never hesitate the homosexuality's behaviour person cuz its define by their gentical way of only so we should accept them in our country and they also like us actually am not homosexuality kind of girl but as a girl I support them

Eng_444	omg they deserves a huge respect in our society😭
Eng_445	Acting vera level bro👌👌👌👌👌👌
Eng_446	The real kindness and humanity is here
Eng_447	It's not Article 377, it's Section 377 of Indian Penal Code
Eng_448	Aww!Heart touching vedio 💖
Eng_449	edward dany i m very sorry.. yr heterosexual identity based on sexual desire as well. It is not about yr sexual glad it is more than that. Shallow minded people like u can’t grasp it. See it as a emotional need instead of physical. I m pretty sure elderly people stick together based on love which is beyond sexual desire.
Eng_450	Hats off sakothari
Eng_451	Without seeing full video I like it 😘😍😘
Eng_452	stepping out of ur comfort zone tis is the real success bro👏#frank talk make more bold videos bro😊
Eng_453	First of all, the interviewer is not asking the right question.. SC did not say gay sex is right or wrong.. They have just declared mutual gay sex is not crime and they should be treated as equal as any heterosexual person.. Individual opinion about gay sex is not the question here..
Eng_454	I just want them to mingle in society a society without discrimination of caste, languages, religion and gender our TAMILNADU should change 🙏🙏🙏
Eng_455	Black Onyx 🤝✌🙌🙌🙌🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈
Eng_456	You 9 thana
Eng_457	Ishvar Mahendiran... 😊no.. I m not talking about external.. (Not about beauty at all). This world wud look at these ppl differently for sure as they see the transgender.!! Can u change the world of T ransgenders? Same way u cant change the people's perception!!!. Everything has been inside the blood. U cant change!
Eng_458	This short film was mentioned & Appreciated in the Hindu Tamil newspaper Sunday edition 3 or 4 weeks before. Since that I was searching it in you tube & couldn't find this short film. A Well needed & Bold registered short film for upcoming Social changes. And a big 👏👏👌for behindwoods for uploading this short film.
Eng_459	Video was informative and interesting, still things have to be proved how this phenomenon is happening, which is quite precise that the existence of homosexuality is natural or not.if we start saying it is individual rights to live their lives on their own terms then why do we have law and order, jail , police, because even a dacoity or rapist has his own terms and reason to commit a crime....

Eng_479	Nakeeran please dont promote these kind of interviews coz this interview is not filtered by youtube regarding adultery so viewer's that any age could watch this video so the post could disturb psychologically a person who never heard about these kind of relationships notably viewers below 16. So please dont post these kind of videos on your behalf. It is a very kind request from follower of NAKEERAN sir. Sendhil from France.
Eng_480	Kadhayalla Nijam bro....if we like our dogs or cats...will we do sex with them.....??? We can like everyone but we can't live with them???? Am I right ??? It will start like this only ...after some time they will say we can marry animals ? Do you accept that ???

Eng_516	Hi... bro From kerala First time uga video pakkuren supper... supper acting അടിപൊളി 👍👍👍 Waiting for part 2
Eng_517	Wooowww.. I felt Latif's father's dialogue reflects as mine... That's what I said to my mom and friends, when they asked questions.. Now they all accepted me as I am. As mentioned in this movie, will take time for a person to accept you. But no worries, believe in yourself and be yourself.. Nowadays, society changing much better. All is well.
Eng_518	Mam super speach about ur life....

Eng_523	Pls tmp heart iam big big fan tell my star of the vidio my name aravindhan mjk
Eng_524	Buauty full 💔💔💔
Eng_525	Then you don't have options . And those women are not slaves . No one forces them to live like that. They love it , they feel secure and they find their own path most probably a right one. Go and ask your father that he ever buy a property in the name of your mother. We gave equal property rights to the women. We gave education . Do you know there are more than 70% of women are employed and equally paid . Yes they are covering their body for their safety. You forefathers looted your grannies treasures in the name of Dowry. In Suadi Arabia Dowry and Interest are prohibited . So don't call them slaves again.
Eng_526	7:42 and 9:00 look the way she tries to convince him not to die, I can't stop crying. Thats the true love of transgender. But please dont fool them for your views. Please give respect to them.
Eng_527	Brother Vera level act
Eng_528	I do understand her words but not their feelings.So do not stand by the majority to discriminate these people ....just give out your point of view

Eng_538	Such a great movie. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😇😢
Eng_539	Sooo cute akka..... U look very bold..... Through this we can learn to enjoy life...On our way
Eng_540	You're doing a good job in helping.. Helping should not be published as it's not the right way
Eng_541	I'm sure people don't like the title of this video. It's obvious this channel did it for clickbait but it can be used in a positive way as well. For people that are transgender or going to become transgender this video can be a motivation that transgenders are able to rise from all challenges and be happy and successful.
Eng_542	Actually they are kind hearted..congrats for showing their good side
Eng_543	Τζέγκαν voice after watching na.....😑
Eng_544	inshaf cool so u are indirectly telling that u can’t change the nature of a rapist and let him rape girls because it’s his nature
Eng_545	Though I don't support same sex marriages , I support transgender rights & naturalism (nudity included). There's a famous quote by a female non English European nudist- ; NUDISTS HAVE NO PROBLEM BEFRIENDING PEOPLE WHO ARE DRESSED BUT ITS NOT VICE VERSA. 😂. FYI, ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS WERE WAY MORE MODERNISED THAN PRESENT UNIVERSE.
Eng_546	Talk about marriage
Eng_547	The story line is pathetic and very confusing. Better luck next time
Eng_548	Murugan Balakrishna i cant find your name also u not reply thanks bye
Eng_549	The one who r saying it's wrong it's shit it's all silly. Hey we r not forcing u guys to be homosexual nor lesbian it's our life we r leading we r not harming anyone then y the hell this opinions.now me being homosexual can I say to a heterosexual u don't love a girl don't marry a girl u marry a boy it's a dictatorship right who u to control our wish our heart . It's my right that with whom I wanna live . The only difference between us is we spread love n u r showing hateredness. Is this u called humanity.
Eng_550	Lots of respect to our sisters
Eng_551	Keep doing this,you will also get arrested soon...
Eng_552	Elam ok bro.. Force panni How can u love ur wife so much being a gay? I dont understand how s it possible bro.. Ungala neengale yemathringala..

Eng_568	Fools......why can't you find solutions to come out of it?? rather than burn with unatural desires
Eng_569	Well said Madan. If we support homosexuality the society thinks we also gay or bi that is the problem here. Anyway they are also human beings Respect all 😊😊
Eng_570	Avangalukkum yevlo feelings irukkum so that's correct
Eng_571	Love your speech
Eng_572	Well appreciatable topic but questions to the ones who are not being practicle, when it comes to our whole population itself 70% of the men will be a gay(homosexuals) when it comes to a public concert our beloved, cultured.., blaa blaaa.., men will stand against to the problem thats the only problem with our country people, so it is also a considerable issue to our society.
Eng_573	Gay marriage is possible in todays society?
Eng_574	don't leave everything to society and anyways people today have lots of works to do Sp no one is really bothered to peep in others personal life....u can maintain ur privacy with the help of ur partner and parents.....instead of assuming something will happen and society will interfere it is better to take a chance for ur life in secured way
Eng_575	Don't cry pa...
Eng_576	Even I'm a gay.. what I had faced in my life. As same as you... None for me .. more than my parents.
Eng_577	Royal Queen Know where feminism started.It was started by a jewish women.Women in south were satisfied with their life until some people came in portrayed badly..I dont wanna continue this argument

Also I've read the results of those researches. And no research is exactly complete other than some which are born out of cruelty. Research studies aren't even complete fr diabetes and hypertension do u prevent ppl from taking drugs fr them? Or do u mind ur own business?

Eng_675	You are right bro...
Eng_676	Royal Queen Ok i agree with you but knowledge can be stolen.Americans got a patent for using turmeric for healing properties.But these are already used by Indians for many years.Fortunately ,we got the patent back.I never abused a women for a dress.This dress is decent only.There r some scientific reasons for every practices we do(Indians) and there r good men as well.Yoga that we learn today are not original.Yoga became business nowadays just like how education became.Stealing an idea from a guy and claiming it as his invention is knowledge theft.
Eng_677	Typing in english is Western culture, YouTube is Western culture. Not advisable!!!!
Eng_678	Yes she is beautiful
Eng_679	Govt pls provide some job for those ppl.. so that even they can lead there life n even we wl b hpy without their torture.. Politicians: instead of blaming among urself better look into these kind of issues n make ppl to leave in peaceful environment.

Eng_747	Some of the things i really hate from this video clipping.... Here some of the people are thinking that the decriminalisation of the section 377 makes every men to marry a men only and every female to.femeale..... bullshit LGBT is not a choice first think that this foolish people Epdi oru paiyanukku ponnu mela aasai varutho.. athae maathiri payanukku oru paiyan mela aasai varum... ithu completely natural... thats the gay relationship.... and its not about any man can choose a man as a life partner as it is because of the liberalisation of 377 Indian people have no sence no intelligence that what is actually LGBT They only think about sex scenes in the foreign language films when talk about LGBT Bullshit...
Eng_748	Nice... But it seems to be scripted...
Eng_749	Anna I'm crying because ur acting super anna 😭😭

Eng_753	Latif character is awesome. Script and dialogue is remarkable.
Eng_754	Sanjiv a I m extremely..Just because she can’t have “straight “ relationship that doesn’t mean she can’t have any other option. Besides that it is her wish and why are u forcing her to be something that she not into. Don’t u think u violating her privacy?
Eng_755	Penguin S aiyo ...he changed his opinion about lgbt..not changing him ..
Eng_756	Thank God I born in 2k.. And being a proud gay...

Eng_758	Education ppl ty wer agree in lgbt Non education ppl ty wer not agree
Eng_759	super bro..its correct bro...
Eng_760	For a moment I laughed on people who really don't know what is happening in the reality. Simply giving comments without humanity. Love is love always. Love has no gender. I think people should be mature enough.
Eng_761	Lathif character is amazing.....
Eng_762	It's a person's own choice. The thing that Indians care about is the baby. Why don't you guys look at adoption as a choice and most importantly it's their choice of having baby.
Eng_763	If u have six sense u might understand it but sadly u are not...
Eng_764	This is simply amazing . Suggested by one of my frnd who s a gay . I don’t believe in these kind pf relationships but after watching this , i feel happy . It would be better if i get a chance to talk to character latif ☺️ can anyone pls arrange ?

Eng_807	Waiting for part 2
Eng_808	This is not a mental disorder issues , actually this is related to changes of hormones... it’s could happen in anyone anytime & any ages... like boys, should avoid many type of foods which got more contents of female hormones (Estrogen)example as below:; Seeds: flaxseeds and sesame seeds.; Fruit: apricots, oranges, strawberries, peaches, many dried fruits.; Vegetables: yams, carrots, alfalfa sprouts, kale, celery.; Soy products: tofu, miso soup, soy yogurt.; Dark rye bread.; Legumes: lentils, peas, pinto beans.; Olives and olive oil.; Chickpeas..... men should avoid most of soy products and women should reduce consuming above food after 40’s ... ; For men should take more drumsticks & leaf (moringai/Oleifera) is the best than also oyster, selfish, egg york, almonds, are will increase the male hormones accordingly.. so it’s nothing to do with attitudes or mental .... all about hormones truly... Basically more gays than lesbians in the world due to (XY ) the chances to adopt famines character are very high... so pls maintain your diet accordingly.. you are what you eat(return in Bagavad Gita) all the best ; to all & no offense to anyone . TC
Eng_809	Beautiful movie 😍✨❤ very close to real life incidents. No nudity, no sex, neatly shown. All the characters have done great job!! Especially mother's role, was heart touching. I loved it. An excellent message conveyed through this movie.There is an equal responsibility of both coming out guys and parents to understand and accept the facts. Kids should convince parents in any way as parents deserve to know the real us. Also parents should understand and love the kids for however and whatever they are.

Eng_824	Hope they will
Eng_825	Men,woman,transgender, straight,gay,lesbian all are equal
Eng_826	SOME People support lesbianism gayism blah blah, if someone questioning them , they shout us back IT'S LOVE BETWEEN TWO HEART but if we ask Do you support love between two sisters ... They got no answers
Eng_827	this is just so good. 🔥✨
Eng_828	All the best for your future ! Everything will be alright !
Eng_829	These people gave their statement casually but they should have some sense that their comments are really offensive.
Eng_830	Makeup by Yesu And proud of you bro
Eng_831	Hai your Jop is awesome
Eng_832	No homosexual is not right thing to do To avoid this parents must pay full attention on their childrens activities and teach a good manners in them
Eng_833	Parents and society needs to be educated on this issue to understand the real struggle of LGBTQ community. Keeps your religious fairy tales to yourself, do not rub it in my communities face.
Eng_834	This is a very good movie and a tool for parents. My parents did not question me when I said I was gay. They only knew that I didn't want to die anymore. That was all they needed.
Eng_835	In future a group of people will come & claim that they wants to marry a Animal, own Father, Mother, Sister & Brother, if someone says it's unnatural then they will say you are not too modern or your thoughts are not mature to understand the pure love; they are also have freedom to choose with whom they want to love. We should respect their feelings they are also humans, at the end love is love, if our feelings attracted to Animals or own parents & siblings what we can do. am i correct guys (LGBTQ COMMUNITY)!!?; 🌈🐵🐻🦁🐯🐱🐶🐺🐴🐮🦛🦌🐷👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩💑👩‍❤️‍👩; ; Hit the like button below those who are against this kind of act or community & share your thoughts. 👇👍

Eng_882	Ajmath Nisha Anarbasha You think that will solve the issue? That’s just lazy idea. And it won’t work. Acknowledge the issue and evolve as a community. Can’t close our eyes and hope that the issue will resolve itself.
Eng_883	Sanjiv a I very sure u are Hindu and how come u can be this narrow. Hindu one of the religion that never label anyone. Hindu never condemn lgbt! Any idea what happened to arjunan during his vanavasam? Shigandi? Lord aiyappan?

But he was so angered and cried,, control his anger.because the government control them and put case against the poor people,,why they want to become a trans,god made us by his own breath 😔😔..this wat they do😔😔😔😔, I can't write anymore 😞😔

Eng_917	Transgender pathi soneenga but full details kedachatha enakku thonala!!!!!!!
Eng_918	Super Malini all the best 😍👍
Eng_919	Common people cannot understand the DNA abberations. Gay/Lesbians does not become gay/lesbian by choice or desire. They are born with that. We hide this and get the son/daughter married by force and destroy the life of the girl/boy. I have seen several cases around me.
Eng_920	Happy to see such a beautiful movie made in tamil....😍❤
Eng_921	Prateekshaa Mister I've read about it more than u. I've read the long judgement of supreme court as well. If the courts have given the decision, they've surely done it by reading reports of worlds best medical sciences and too and fro judgement for years now. And I've read many world. medical reports on these. So I guess u need to be more educated. Check ur sources and read properly to get more knowledge. Pls don't comment with half baked facts
Eng_922	This akka is next level super
Eng_923	I feel it 😔 So cute true heart 🤝🤝🤝🤝
Eng_924	First of all, i wanna know onething. Do you think oppression & harashment all happen only in lgbtq? it is everywhere. Each individual is having their own struggle. just becoz you become make up artist from lgbtq , you think you have inspired masses.. ? Pls dont say people as fans .. whom do you think you are ? you are no spl. you are normal as we are.. You have nt done anything spl...
Eng_925	Sheik Dawood Where's the concept of a wife in a gay relationship?. And, it's totally suitable for all environments. Coz, it's human and natural. And, it's not a culture. It's a sexual orientation. No one becomes a gay, and no one can be forced to become gay. It's all inborn.
Eng_926	Kindly upload the music video, thank you 🥰❤
Eng_927	Kadhayalla Nijam yeah bro. Lord is the source for happiness, peace and love. Lord jesus christ always loved people, who believe in him. ; ; Lord jesus christ loves gay people because God is the father of his own children

Eng_985	Ur really great akka 😍♥️🥰💜
Eng_986	Looks like Karthik took advantage on Varun when he loses his main love and shadows which is from his mother ,just in very short period of time they get into very intimated relationship and of course Varun is good looking by face and physique..,btw overall its a well emotion plays..my eyes got wet.the mother character shows incomplete acceptance in the ending..just viewers should assume anything..Me too from LGBT community I'm looking for friends with similar feelings and sexuality..I wish I'll have someone to support ,pamper and love me like this
Eng_987	i am really crying pro😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭
Eng_988	They may be transgender but don't ever forgot that they are also humans !!!! If humanity still exist means love them !!!!!
Eng_989	It is their own choice. I support them No doubt about it. They are also humans and right to live in the society.
Eng_990	Waited for a long time congrts team... such a emotional concept... amma and varun's acting fabulous.... this movie should get credited
