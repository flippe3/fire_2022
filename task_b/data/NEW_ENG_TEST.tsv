Homophobic	excellent movie..no unnecessary drama or scenes.. was very natural..back ground music is really superb..thank u everyone involved fr giving a wonderful movie to watch..best thing was the lead actors were depicted MALE-ISH.. quite contrary to most directors who like to show gay love happens between some one who has FEMININE body and thoughts..well done sir. Looking forward fr more movies frm U.
Homophobic	For those who speak about culture., pre marital sex, illegal affairs after marriage, rape and a long lost will continue which is not Indian culture . Being gay/ lesbian/ transgender Is hormone imbalance, even before they are born. It’s not they choose to become. Even your son or daughter can be.. Like if you agree, and I don’t care for dislikes or hate replies.

Homophobic	Sathya Narayanan , it was encouraged in western world even today.. It's seen as an alternative to marriage.. For example, Few women groups say/encourage this way of life to escape from men, they claim men are aggressive n dominant.. Escape from them n stay with your own gender.. I meant those kind of things... Of course it's a threat to humanity.. It's one of the main reason why white ppl are becoming minorities in the own land..
Homophobic	A simple well scripted and acted out movie that addresses the issue with due intensity. And a very soothing yet powerful music to compliment the scenes. Congrats to the team.

Homophobic	There are really some people who's brain needs to be grown.. Let the person be homosexual or hetro or bisexual or transgender - treat everyone as humans.. What's wrong in it.. How male and female have feelings and attraction towards each other... Same male male or female female also have.. It's genetics what you or me can do. It's natural..there are even people like bisexual. They get attraction towards male and even females both.. It's not wrong.. Culture culture what culture you guys expecting.. If we say male to not have sex with female..? Is it okay.. Same like that gay or lesbians.. Understand that they are born like that.. It's natural.. Treat everyone as humans.. And don't be abusive.. You have no rights to decriminate others feelings..
Homophobic	Pls bro don't play with anyone fellings. If anyone in that fellings to ask help from anyone, they think it's prank. and pls be serious bro
Homophobic	We support LGBT...that girl is stylish and awesome...

Are your guts not full with the Bollywood and tollywood bigotry that you are bring this bullshit here too? shame on you.

Homophobic	You father is getting by homosexual then how to you born in the world. Your speech was not justice for human being very talented. So your homosexual thinking created and developed by yourself and by your living situation. That's your problem so don't criticize to anybody for this issues. Peoples be allotted and keep to distance of this type of guys I advise to all the peoples especially for young generations. This is our culturally very bad and worst activities and God's is not creating this type of homosexual man's and lespian woman's.

Homophobic	havish srinivasula we think tat if schools n other institutions do not ask our caste then we will forget it. Tats a myth. Do u think caste is such a small thing tat ppl will forget. NO. It may happen in some cities. But India majority is village. Ppl always remember their caste, take pride in tat and discriminate others. Reservation system is their to give some relief to the discriminated ppl. ; ; So root cause of reservation system is discrimination.; ; Reservation is just a remedy to give relief.; ; We cannot remove remedy first. tat will be unfair.; ; We should remove the root cause first. Then eventually remedy will not be required. And we can achieve reservation system free society.

Homophobic	Thank you so much for all the actors and I would like to say to everyone that IM GAY and I really loved it. And this is what even now after 3 years, it still happens and many lgbtq are leaving their homes and roaming in streets. And many are under corrective rape, and some are being killed and physically abused and many are still thinking thst being lgbtq is a disease or illness. Even my parents say it to me daily even though they know thsg I'm gay. I wish they will change.

Homophobic	Vasim asaraf k u think this culture understands femininity. This culture is the first one that teaches wrong femininity. Letz not go to Islam. tatz a shock. letz take Tamil literature only as example. Four qualities of a woman. Accham, madam, naanam , payirpu. Just tell me in this four qualities, which is useful for woman or mother? According to me femininity is mother tatz it. Im asking what ur culture has thought to that mother? u guyz speak very high abt mother bt u speak bad about woman. U say she is weak. How can a weak woman become a mother? Todays mother are future generation. Have we thought this to our women? Leave feminism did culture understand women?

Homophobic	edward dany i m very sorry.. yr heterosexual identity based on sexual desire as well. It is not about yr sexual glad it is more than that. Shallow minded people like u can’t grasp it.

Homophobic	This short film was mentioned & Appreciated in the Hindu Tamil newspaper Sunday edition 3 or 4 weeks before. Since that I was searching it in you tube & couldn't find this short film. A Well needed & Bold registered short film for upcoming Social changes. And a big 👏👏👌for behindwoods for uploading this short film.
Homophobic	Video was informative and interesting, still things have to be proved how this phenomenon is happening, which is quite precise that the existence of homosexuality is natural or not.if we start saying it is individual rights to live their lives on their own terms then why do we have law and order, jail , police, because even a dacoity or rapist has his own terms and reason to commit a crime....

Homophobic	Then you don't have options . And those women are not slaves . No one forces them to live like that. They love it , they feel secure and they find their own path most probably a right one. Go and ask your father that he ever buy a property in the name of your mother. We gave equal property rights to the women. We gave education . Do you know there are more than 70% of women are employed and equally paid . Yes they are covering their body for their safety. You forefathers looted your grannies treasures in the name of Dowry. In Suadi Arabia Dowry and Interest are prohibited . So don't call them slaves again.
Homophobic	7:42 and 9:00 look the way she tries to convince him not to die, I can't stop crying. Thats the true love of transgender. But please dont fool them for your views. Please give respect to them.

Homophobic	You're doing a good job in helping.. Helping should not be published as it's not the right way
Homophobic	I'm sure people don't like the title of this video. It's obvious this channel did it for clickbait but it can be used in a positive way as well. For people that are transgender or going to become transgender this video can be a motivation that transgenders are able to rise from all challenges and be happy and successful.
Homophobic	Actually they are kind hearted..congrats for showing their good side
Homophobic	Τζέγκαν voice after watching na.....😑
Homophobic	inshaf cool so u are indirectly telling that u can’t change the nature of a rapist and let him rape girls because it’s his nature
Homophobic	Though I don't support same sex marriages , I support transgender rights & naturalism (nudity included). There's a famous quote by a female non English European nudist- ; NUDISTS HAVE NO PROBLEM BEFRIENDING PEOPLE WHO ARE DRESSED BUT ITS NOT VICE VERSA. 😂. FYI, ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS WERE WAY MORE MODERNISED THAN PRESENT UNIVERSE.

Homophobic	Gay marriage is possible in todays society?
Homophobic	don't leave everything to society and anyways people today have lots of works to do Sp no one is really bothered to peep in others personal life....u can maintain ur privacy with the help of ur partner and parents.....instead of assuming something will happen and society will interfere it is better to take a chance for ur life in secured way

Also I've read the results of those researches. And no research is exactly complete other than some which are born out of cruelty. Research studies aren't even complete fr diabetes and hypertension do u prevent ppl from taking drugs fr them? Or do u mind ur own business?

Homophobic	You are right bro...
Homophobic	Royal Queen Ok i agree with you but knowledge can be stolen.Americans got a patent for using turmeric for healing properties.But these are already used by Indians for many years.Fortunately ,we got the patent back.I never abused a women for a dress.This dress is decent only.There r some scientific reasons for every practices we do(Indians) and there r good men as well.Yoga that we learn today are not original.Yoga became business nowadays just like how education became.Stealing an idea from a guy and claiming it as his invention is knowledge theft.
Homophobic	Typing in english is Western culture, YouTube is Western culture. Not advisable!!!!

Homophobic	rohit royals ,you that type? Or not.?
Homophobic	Some of the things i really hate from this video clipping.... Here some of the people are thinking that the decriminalisation of the section 377 makes every men to marry a men only and every female to.femeale..... bullshit LGBT is not a choice first think that this foolish people Epdi oru paiyanukku ponnu mela aasai varutho.. athae maathiri payanukku oru paiyan mela aasai varum... ithu completely natural... thats the gay relationship.... and its not about any man can choose a man as a life partner as it is because of the liberalisation of 377 Indian people have no sence no intelligence that what is actually LGBT They only think about sex scenes in the foreign language films when talk about LGBT Bullshit...
Homophobic	Nice... But it seems to be scripted...
Homophobic	Anna I'm crying because ur acting super anna 😭😭
Homophobic	Bro tell me Vikings and Zeus history

Homophobic	very very good Movie. Latif role really was awesome. but it to b extended. but we should get the good character like Latif to feel the real happiness. waiting for my Latif..
Homophobic	Latif character is awesome. Script and dialogue is remarkable.
Homophobic	Sanjiv a I m extremely..Just because she can’t have “straight “ relationship that doesn’t mean she can’t have any other option. Besides that it is her wish and why are u forcing her to be something that she not into. Don’t u think u violating her privacy?
Homophobic	Penguin S aiyo ...he changed his opinion about lgbt..not changing him ..
Homophobic	Thank God I born in 2k.. And being a proud gay...
Homophobic	Love is love
Homophobic	Education ppl ty wer agree in lgbt Non education ppl ty wer not agree
Homophobic	super bro..its correct bro...
Homophobic	For a moment I laughed on people who really don't know what is happening in the reality. Simply giving comments without humanity. Love is love always. Love has no gender. I think people should be mature enough.
Homophobic	Lathif character is amazing.....
Homophobic	It's a person's own choice. The thing that Indians care about is the baby. Why don't you guys look at adoption as a choice and most importantly it's their choice of having baby.
Homophobic	If u have six sense u might understand it but sadly u are not...
Homophobic	This is simply amazing . Suggested by one of my frnd who s a gay . I don’t believe in these kind pf relationships but after watching this , i feel happy . It would be better if i get a chance to talk to character latif ☺️ can anyone pls arrange ?

Homophobic	Waiting for part 2
Homophobic	This is not a mental disorder issues , actually this is related to changes of hormones... it’s could happen in anyone anytime & any ages... like boys, should avoid many type of foods which got more contents of female hormones (Estrogen)example as below:; Seeds: flaxseeds and sesame seeds.; Fruit: apricots, oranges, strawberries, peaches, many dried fruits.; Vegetables: yams, carrots, alfalfa sprouts, kale, celery.; Soy products: tofu, miso soup, soy yogurt.; Dark rye bread.; Legumes: lentils, peas, pinto beans.; Olives and olive oil.; Chickpeas..... men should avoid most of soy products and women should reduce consuming above food after 40’s ... ; For men should take more drumsticks & leaf (moringai/Oleifera) is the best than also oyster, selfish, egg york, almonds, are will increase the male hormones accordingly.. so it’s nothing to do with attitudes or mental .... all about hormones truly... Basically more gays than lesbians in the world due to (XY ) the chances to adopt famines character are very high... so pls maintain your diet accordingly.. you are what you eat(return in Bagavad Gita) all the best ; to all & no offense to anyone . TC
Homophobic	Beautiful movie 😍✨❤ very close to real life incidents. No nudity, no sex, neatly shown. All the characters have done great job!! Especially mother's role, was heart touching. I loved it. An excellent message conveyed through this movie.There is an equal responsibility of both coming out guys and parents to understand and accept the facts. Kids should convince parents in any way as parents deserve to know the real us. Also parents should understand and love the kids for however and whatever they are.

Homophobic	No homosexual is not right thing to do To avoid this parents must pay full attention on their childrens activities and teach a good manners in them
Homophobic	Parents and society needs to be educated on this issue to understand the real struggle of LGBTQ community. Keeps your religious fairy tales to yourself, do not rub it in my communities face.
Homophobic	This is a very good movie and a tool for parents. My parents did not question me when I said I was gay. They only knew that I didn't want to die anymore. That was all they needed.
Homophobic	In future a group of people will come & claim that they wants to marry a Animal, own Father, Mother, Sister & Brother, if someone says it's unnatural then they will say you are not too modern or your thoughts are not mature to understand the pure love; they are also have freedom to choose with whom they want to love. We should respect their feelings they are also humans, at the end love is love, if our feelings attracted to Animals or own parents & siblings what we can do. am i correct guys (LGBTQ COMMUNITY)!!?; 🌈🐵🐻🦁🐯🐱🐶🐺🐴🐮🦛🦌🐷👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩💑👩‍❤️‍👩; ; Hit the like button below those who are against this kind of act or community & share your thoughts. 👇👍

Homophobic	Common people cannot understand the DNA abberations. Gay/Lesbians does not become gay/lesbian by choice or desire. They are born with that. We hide this and get the son/daughter married by force and destroy the life of the girl/boy. I have seen several cases around me.
Homophobic	Happy to see such a beautiful movie made in tamil....😍❤
Homophobic	Prateekshaa Mister I've read about it more than u. I've read the long judgement of supreme court as well. If the courts have given the decision, they've surely done it by reading reports of worlds best medical sciences and too and fro judgement for years now. And I've read many world. medical reports on these. So I guess u need to be more educated. Check ur sources and read properly to get more knowledge. Pls don't comment with half baked facts
Homophobic	This akka is next level super
Homophobic	I feel it 😔 So cute true heart 🤝🤝🤝🤝
Homophobic	First of all, i wanna know onething. Do you think oppression & harashment all happen only in lgbtq? it is everywhere. Each individual is having their own struggle. just becoz you become make up artist from lgbtq , you think you have inspired masses.. ? Pls dont say people as fans .. whom do you think you are ? you are no spl. you are normal as we are.. You have nt done anything spl...
Homophobic	Sheik Dawood Where's the concept of a wife in a gay relationship?. And, it's totally suitable for all environments. Coz, it's human and natural. And, it's not a culture. It's a sexual orientation. No one becomes a gay, and no one can be forced to become gay. It's all inborn.
Homophobic	Kindly upload the music video, thank you 🥰❤
Homophobic	Kadhayalla Nijam yeah bro. Lord is the source for happiness, peace and love. Lord jesus christ always loved people, who believe in him. ; ; Lord jesus christ loves gay people because God is the father of his own children

Homophobic	Looks like Karthik took advantage on Varun when he loses his main love and shadows which is from his mother ,just in very short period of time they get into very intimated relationship and of course Varun is good looking by face and physique..,btw overall its a well emotion plays..my eyes got wet.the mother character shows incomplete acceptance in the ending..just viewers should assume anything..Me too from LGBT community I'm looking for friends with similar feelings and sexuality..I wish I'll have someone to support ,pamper and love me like this
Homophobic	i am really crying pro😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭
Homophobic	They may be transgender but don't ever forgot that they are also humans !!!! If humanity still exist means love them !!!!!
Homophobic	It is their own choice. I support them No doubt about it. They are also humans and right to live in the society.
